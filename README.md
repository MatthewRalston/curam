# README

curam : a utility for system maintenance for Arch Linux

## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MatthewRalston/curam.git
cd curam
makepkg
#namcap PKGBUILD
#namcap curam-x.x.x-x-any.pkg.tar.gz
```

## Documentation

Documentation can be found in `src/man/curam.1` and build with `make docs` in `src` 

### Usage

```bash
curam -h # Display manpage
curam <-t|--task TASK>

```

### Tasks

* news :

Fetches news about Arch Linux packages.

* upgrade :

Begins by updating the mirrorlist and fetching warnings/news since last upgrade. 

Full system upgrade `pacman -Syu` (`yaourt -Syu` if available)

Package library rebuild, remove orphaned/dropped packages.

Display `.pacsave`/`.pacnew` files and paclog's warnings.

* clean :

Pacman cache is cleaned with `paccache -r`, except 3 recent packages versions.

Locate, report, and remove any broken symlinks in the system.

* errors :

The system logs are mined for errors with `journalctl -p 3 -xb`

System daemon launch failures shown with `systemctl --failed`

* backup :

OS, user home, and media rsync backup to `$BACKUP_LOCATION/backups/current`

.tar.gz snapshot of current, saved to `$BACKUP_LOCATION/backups/tarballs`

S3 sync snapshots to `s3://$BUCKET`, using `$DEFAULT_USER`'s `~/.aws/credentials`

Run as root user, preserves permissions of files, and media.

* restore :

Rsync restore of `$BACKUP_LOCATION/backups/current` backup in `--dry-run` mode only

NOTE: This feature is experimental and catastrophic. Always restore manually.

* config :

Print configurations from `etc/curam/`

### Configuration

* $STORAGE :

Defined in `etc/curam/curam.conf`

Primary storage location for a 'current' rsync snapshot and tarballs.

* $EXTERNAL :

Defined in `etc/curam/curam.conf`

An external HDD or location for media and home directory backups.

* $BUCKET :

Defined in `etc/curam/curam.conf`

Destination S3 bucket for tarballs. Omits the `s3://` prefix.

e.g. `STORAGE=my-personal-snapshots` (not `s3://my-personal-snapshots`)

* $DEFAULT_USER :

Defined in `etc/curam/curam.conf`

User to default to and refer to during backup routines.

This user should have AWS credentials defined in `$HOME/.aws/credentials`

* $OS_EXCLUDES :

Defined in `etc/curam/os_excludes.conf` (Remember the trailing \n)

A list of paths to pass to `rsync` with `--exclude=...`

These are OS path components to exclude from the operating system backup.

Good choices are personal directories, media libraries, and large datasets

* $HOME_EXCLUDES :

Defined in `etc/curam/home_excludes.conf` (Remember the trailing \n)

A list of path components to exclude from the home directory backup.

Good choices are subdirectories in `~/.cache`, `~/.config`, etc.

* $MEDIA_EXCLUDES :

Defined in `etc/curam/media_excludes.conf` (Remember the trailing \n)

A list of path components to exclude from media directory backup.

No defaults. Depends on your organization of your media library.

* $SYMLINKS_CHECK :

Defined in `etc/curam/symlinks_check.conf` (Remember the trailing \n)

A list of directories to recur into while searching for broken symlinks.

  Michael Dobachesky provided the original concept for Arch maintenance in his 'maint' package on AUR. His script `archNews.py` is used for AUR/Pacman warnings in this package.
  Thanks for the inspiration Michael.
